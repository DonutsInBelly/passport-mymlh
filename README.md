# passport-mymlh

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating with [MyMLH](https://my.mlh.io/)
using the OAuth 2.0 API.

This module lets you authenticate using MyMLH in your Node.js applications.
By plugging into Passport, MyMLH authentication can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).
